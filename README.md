# Password Generator in React

THINGS LERANT WHILE BUILDING THIS:

useEffect Hook: useEffect hook runs on every re-render, when used with dependencies useEffect is called when the dependencies changed. 
In my project whenever the user configure the setting to generate the password, onClickedhandler() is called which is wraped inside the useEffect hook

State Management: State Management is fundamental thing in react and with small project I have gained the understanding for state management with hooks like useState.

Folder Structure: The naming conventions, components.jsx files, how the html code is linked to react's main App component is what I will always have back of the mind while building next projects.


This was a small project but as a beginner it was important to me. Do give a star I you liked my project!
